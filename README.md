# AI Profile Picture Maker
<p>This is AI Profile Picture Maker and i made this with object detection technology using <a href="https://www.tensorflow.org/js/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Tensorflow.js</a> and
                        <a href="https://github.com/tensorflow/tfjs-models/tree/master/coco-ssd" target="_blank" rel="noopener">COCO-SSD</a> models.</p>

<p><strong>Object detection</strong> is a computer technology related to computer vision and image
processing that deals with detecting instances of semantic objects of a certain class (such as humans,
buildings, or cars) in digital images and videos. <a href="https://github.com/tensorflow/models/blob/master/research/object_detection/README.md"

<p><strong>TensorFlow.js</strong> is a library for machine learning in JavaScript. <br>
<strong>COCO</strong> is a large-scale object detection, segmentation, and captioning dataset.
